# ANN_Mushroom

Using the Artificial Neural Network Model to build a classification model that train on a mushroom dataset with 22 predictors and predict whether a given type of mushroom is poisonous. 

Dataset contains 22 predictors and 8124 observations
Each species is labeled as “edible” or “poisonous”

Input variables:
cap-shape, cap-surface, cap-color are cap features.
bruises	odor of the mushroom.
gill-attachment, gill-spacing, gill-size, gill-color are grill features.
stalk-shape, stalk-root, stalk-surface-above-ring, stalk-surface-below-ring, stalk-color-above-ring, stalk-color-below-ring are stalk features.
veil-type, veil-color are veil features.
ring-number, ring-type are ring features.
spore-print-color	
population, habitat are other characteristics of the mushroom.
